# pyFlaskBlueprints

**NOTE!** Under heavy development, expect large changes to functionality and structure!

The idea is to provide some functions to make the development of flask apps easier.

This includes utilities such as 

- user management
  - login
  - logout
  - roles
  - permissions
- syncing with git repos
  - sync with private bitbucket repo
  - sync with private github repo
  - syn with public github repo
